# Interactive Atomic–Cell–Chemistry–Physics Simulation Blueprint

## 1. System Architecture

| Layer | Subsystem | Primary Responsibilities | Key Components | Data Flow | Technologies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Presentation | Visualization UI | 3D scene rendering, layer toggles, overlays, HUD | WebGL-based renderer (Three.js/Unity WebGL), UI framework (React/ImGui) | Consumes state from orchestration services via WebSockets; emits user events | TypeScript/JavaScript, WebGL, WebGPU |
| Presentation | Control Panel | Periodic table selector, environmental sliders, playback controls | Reusable UI widgets, data binding to state store | Publishes user intents to orchestration layer, subscribes to simulation status | TypeScript/React + Zustand/Redux |
| Orchestration | Simulation Director | Coordinates biology, chemistry, physics engines; enforces timestep synchronization | Scheduler, event bus, dependency resolver | Pulls updates from engines, pushes consolidated scene graph updates | Node.js / Rust service |
| Orchestration | Data Broker | Normalizes constants, atom data, pathway definitions | Cache layer, unit conversion utilities | Supplies validated data to engines on demand | Rust/Go microservice |
| Engines | Atomic Selection | Manages active element context and propagates parameter changes | Periodic table store, observer registry | Publishes updates to chemistry/physics/biology engines | Rust/TypeScript module |
| Engines | Chemistry Engine | Reaction simulation, bonding energetics, thermodynamics | Force field calculator, reaction network solver | Sends forces/energies to physics, reaction states to biology | Rust/C++ with CUDA |
| Engines | Physics Engine | Molecular dynamics, constraint solvers, thermodynamic ensembles | GPU kernels, integration schemes, thermostat/barostat | Updates spatial positions, velocities to visualization | C++/CUDA |
| Engines | Biology Engine | Cellular process simulation (translation, trafficking, metabolism) | Organelle process models, signaling pathways | Receives chemical states, outputs biological events/animations | Python/Rust |
| Data | Knowledge Bases | Atomic properties, biochemical pathways, force field constants | PDB, KEGG, BRENDA, PubChem, curated JSON datasets | Accessed via Data Broker | PostgreSQL, S3 |
| Infrastructure | Services | Authentication (future), logging, metrics, scalability | API gateway, Grafana, Prometheus | Aggregates telemetry, controls resource scaling | Kubernetes, gRPC |

System-wide communication leverages an event-driven architecture (NATS/Kafka) ensuring each engine reacts to atomic selection or environmental changes within bounded latency (<50 ms). Shared schemas are versioned via Protocol Buffers.

### 1.1 Simulation Lifecycle (Single Ribosome MVP)
1. **Initialization Phase**
   - Load ribosome-specific assets (geometry, particle templates) and carbon-centric atomic parameters.
   - Data Broker hydrates caches with nucleotide, amino acid, and solvent constants requested by engines.
   - Simulation Director composes initial scene graph and schedules first integration tick.
2. **Event Loop Phase**
   - Presentation layer dispatches user intents (element selection, temperature adjustment) through WebSocket RPCs.
   - Simulation Director resolves dependency order (biology → chemistry → physics) and issues timestep jobs to engine workers.
   - Engines publish state deltas (positions, reactions, biological events) onto the event bus; Visualization UI consumes the consolidated state snapshot.
3. **Persistence & Telemetry Phase**
   - Metrics collectors push per-frame timing, energy drift, and numerical stability data to Prometheus.
   - Significant biological milestones (e.g., peptide bond formation) are journaled to PostgreSQL for replay and validation workflows.
4. **Shutdown Phase**
   - Graceful teardown flushes outstanding GPU buffers, persists final state, and archives configuration for reproducibility.

## 2. Atomic Selection Module

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "element": "Carbon",
  "atomic_number": 6,
  "atomic_mass": 12.011,
  "electron_configuration": "[He] 2s2 2p2",
  "electronegativity": 2.55,
  "oxidation_states": [-4, +4],
  "reduction_potential": -0.25
}
```

### Component Responsibilities
- **PeriodicTableGrid** (UI): Renders clickable tiles; on select, calls `setActiveElement(elementId)`.
- **ElementStateStore**: Maintains current element data; dispatches `ActiveElementChanged` events.
- **Observers**: Chemistry, physics, and biology engines subscribe to element updates via event bus.
- **Validation Layer**: Ensures selected element is supported by downstream force-field and biomolecular templates, falls back to nearest supported parameters.

### Update Propagation
1. User click triggers `setActiveElement` → loads properties from `atomic_properties.json`.
2. Chemistry engine updates bonding parameters (bond order, electronegativity differences) and reaction templates.
3. Physics engine recalculates force-field constants (Lennard-Jones σ/ε, partial charges) and updates atom typing.
4. Biology engine adjusts macromolecule composition tables (e.g., ribosomal RNA modifications, protein side-chain availability).

Latency target: <30 ms from click to visual update.

### Message Schema (Active Element Broadcast)
```proto
message ActiveElementChanged {
  string element_symbol = 1;        // e.g., "C"
  uint32 atomic_number = 2;         // 6
  double atomic_mass = 3;           // 12.011
  repeated int32 oxidation_states = 4; // [-4, +4]
  double electronegativity = 5;     // 2.55 (Pauling scale)
  double reduction_potential = 6;   // Volts
  map<string, double> force_field_overrides = 7; // {"sigma": 3.43, "epsilon": 0.095}
  string provenance = 8;            // DOI or dataset identifier
  uint64 revision = 9;              // Schema version for caching
}
```

### Critical Path Optimizations
- Cache-ready `ElementStateStore` instances are pre-warmed for the 20 ribosome-relevant elements (C, H, O, N, P, S, Mg, Zn, etc.) to avoid file I/O on selection.
- Chemistry and physics engines subscribe via lightweight UDP multicast inside the cluster to minimize broker hops, while biology stays on reliable gRPC streams for ordered event replay.
- Optimistic updates allow the UI to highlight the newly selected element immediately; discrepancies are reconciled when authoritative engine responses arrive (<10 ms).

## 3. 3D Cell Model Rendering

### Rendering Pipeline
1. **Scene Graph**: Hierarchical nodes: Cell → Organelles → Molecular Assemblies → Atoms.
2. **Level of Detail (LOD)**:
   - Macro (LOD0): Smooth organelle meshes (ER, Golgi, nucleus) with volumetric shaders.
   - Meso (LOD1): Molecular complexes (ribosomes, polymerases) using instanced meshes.
   - Micro (LOD2): Atomistic detail via billboards/point sprites for performance.
3. **Animation System**:
   - Keyframe tracks for organelle-scale motions (vesicle transport along microtubules).
   - Particle systems (GPU) for diffusion, ion flux, Brownian motion.
   - Skeletal animation for flexible macromolecules (tRNA bending).
4. **Rendering Stack**:
   - Physically based rendering (PBR) for membranes; subsurface scattering approximations.
   - Screen-space ambient occlusion, volumetric lighting for depth cues.
   - Deferred rendering path for handling large atom counts with instancing.

### Data Sources & Preparation
- **Organelles**: Volumetric meshes derived from electron tomography; stored as glTF with metadata.
- **Ribosome Model**: Start with high-resolution PDB (e.g., 4V6X) converted to multi-resolution LOD assets.
- **Processes**: KEGG pathways → YAML animation scripts defining triggers, rates, and participants.
- **Textures**: Procedural noise for membranes, cytosol; data-driven textures for organelle interiors.

### Interaction
- Camera controls with zoom snapping between LOD levels.
- On selection, highlight node and overlay metrics (e.g., translation rate, ATP consumption).

### Asset Preparation Pipeline (Ribosome)
1. **Acquisition**: Fetch PDB 4V6X and isolate the 70S ribosome chains relevant to translation.
2. **Segmentation**: Use scripting (BioPython + PyMOL) to split rRNA, ribosomal proteins, and nascent peptide for independent LOD tuning.
3. **Decimation**: Generate LOD0–LOD2 meshes using quadric error metrics, targeting 5k/50k/500k triangle budgets respectively.
4. **Annotation**: Embed metadata into glTF extensions (e.g., `KHR_materials_variants`) describing binding sites, catalytic residues, and conformational states.
5. **Packaging**: Bundle assets with texture atlases and animation clips, then publish to CDN/S3 with semantic version tags for cache-busting.

## 4. Chemistry Engine

### Core Modules
- **Bond Classification**: Uses electronegativity difference Δχ to determine covalent vs ionic character.
- **Force Field Calculator**: Applies harmonic potentials for covalent bonds `E = k_bond (r - r0)^2` and Lennard-Jones for noncovalent interactions `V(r) = 4ε[(σ/r)^{12} - (σ/r)^6]`.
- **Thermodynamics Module**: Computes free energy `ΔG = ΔH - TΔS`, integrates Arrhenius kinetics `k = A e^{-E_a/RT}`.
- **Diffusion Module**: Solves concentration gradients `J = -D dC/dx` via finite difference or meshless methods.

### Integration
- Parameter inputs from atomic selection dictate bond orders, partial charges, reaction network templates.
- Outputs reaction rates, energy changes, and updated molecular compositions to physics and biology engines.
- Validated against experimental datasets (NIST, CRC Handbook).

### Numerical Solvers & Data Interfaces
- **Reaction Network Solver**: Employs adaptive-step implicit Runge–Kutta (Radau IIA) with automatic stiffness detection for ribosome-associated kinetics (e.g., GTP hydrolysis).
- **Partial Charge Assignment**: RESP/AM1-BCC pipelines run offline; at runtime, pre-tabulated charges are interpolated per selected element and residue environment.
- **Thermodynamic Queries**: REST/gRPC endpoints `GET /thermo/free-energy?reaction_id=...` return ΔG/ΔH/ΔS computed from curated datasets; caching TTL set to 10 minutes.
- **Validation Harness**: Unit tests compare simulated bond energies against reference QM calculations within ±1 kcal/mol tolerance.

## 5. Physics Engine

### Molecular Dynamics Loop
```
for each timestep Δt:
    calculate_forces()         # includes bonded, nonbonded, electrostatics
    integrate_positions()      # Velocity-Verlet default, Verlet alternative
    apply_constraints()        # SHAKE for bond lengths, RATTLE for angles
    update_temperature()       # Berendsen thermostat; Nose-Hoover optional
    update_pressure()          # Parrinello-Rahman barostat for NPT ensemble
```

### Forces Included
- **Fundamental**: Strong/weak nuclear (parameterized within bonded potentials), gravitational (negligible but modeled for completeness), electromagnetic (Coulombic interactions).
- **Intermolecular**: Covalent, ionic, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals.
- **Mechanical**: Bond stretch, angle bend, dihedral torsion.
- **Environmental**: Osmotic gradients, Brownian forces (Langevin dynamics), hydrodynamic drag.

GPU acceleration via CUDA/OpenCL for nonbonded force calculations; CPU handles constraint resolution.

### GPU Work Distribution (Single Ribosome)
| Kernel | Responsibility | Execution Cadence | Optimization Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `compute_nonbonded_forces` | Lennard-Jones + Coulomb between ribosome atoms and solvent shell | Every timestep | Uses cell lists sized to ribosome bounding box; shared memory reduction for pairwise sums |
| `compute_bonded_forces` | Stretch, bend, torsion for backbone/side chains | Every timestep | Structure-of-arrays layout to maximize coalescing |
| `langevin_noise` | Brownian kicks applied to solvent proxies | Every timestep | Philox RNG seeded per warp, ensuring reproducibility |
| `constraints_shake` | SHAKE solver for constrained bonds (e.g., water, peptide backbone) | Iterative until convergence | Implemented as warp-synchronous Gauss–Seidel |
| `thermostat_update` | Temperature rescaling (Berendsen) | Every timestep | Inline PTX for vectorized scaling |

Constraint corrections are double-buffered to allow overlap between CPU-driven orchestration and GPU computation. Thermalization and barostat kernels run on a dedicated CUDA stream to minimize synchronization penalties.

## 6. Biology–Chemistry–Physics Linking

- **Biology → Chemistry**: ATP hydrolysis in ribosome translocation feeds ΔG to chemistry engine, enabling conformational energy updates.
- **Chemistry → Physics**: Reaction-induced bond formation/breaking adjusts force constants, triggering recalculation in physics engine.
- **Physics → Biology**: Osmotic pressure and mechanical stresses influence vesicle morphology, gating biological events.

Coupling managed by co-simulation framework exchanging data each timestep; predictor-corrector ensures stability.

### Cross-Domain Event Contract
| Event | Publisher → Subscriber | Payload Highlights | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Biology.ATPConsumption` | Biology → Chemistry | ATP count, hydrolysis rate, conformational state ID | Start of elongation substep |
| `Chemistry.BondUpdate` | Chemistry → Physics | Bond indices, new force constants, bond order deltas | Immediately after reaction integration |
| `Physics.MechanicalStress` | Physics → Biology | Stress tensor, osmotic pressure, displacement vectors | Every N timesteps (configurable, default 10) |
| `Director.Sync` | Simulation Director → All engines | Timestep, random seed, environment variables | Every timestep |

Predictor–corrector alignment uses a two-phase handshake: engines publish tentative states, Simulation Director resolves conflicts (e.g., multiple bond changes on same atom) and issues authoritative corrections before the next render frame.

## 7. Interactivity & Controls

- **Click-to-Inspect**: Any entity emits structured metadata panel (atomic properties, reaction rates, biological status).
- **Layer Toggle**: Switch between biology (process overlays), chemistry (energy landscapes), physics (force vectors).
- **Playback Control**: Play/pause, time dilation (0.1×–10×), frame stepping.
- **Environmental Control**: Temperature (273–350 K), pressure (0.8–1.2 atm), concentration sliders; triggers recalibration across engines.
- **Scenario Presets**: Quick-load states (normal translation, stress response, nutrient depletion).

## 8. Implementation Notes

- **Performance**: Scene graph culling, GPU instancing, async compute for force calculations; background loading of LOD assets.
- **Accuracy**: Employ CHARMM36/AMBER ff14SB force fields; parameter validation suite comparing computed vs reference energies.
- **Scalability**: Plugin architecture for new organelles or elements; schema versioning ensures backward compatibility.
- **Data Integrity**: Data ingested via ETL pipeline with provenance metadata; nightly validation against canonical databases.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for numerical kernels, integration tests for cross-engine coupling, regression tests for visualization snapshots.

### Observability & Tooling
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) spans Simulation Director → engine RPCs → GPU kernels to pinpoint latency spikes.
- Deterministic replay mode stores RNG seeds and event logs, enabling regression comparison across builds.
- Developer dashboards show ribosome translation metrics (elongation rate, energy expenditure) with alert thresholds for scientific plausibility.

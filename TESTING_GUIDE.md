# Orbital Caching System - Testing Guide

## Quick Start

The dev server should be running. If not:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5173** (or :5174)

---

## Test Suite

### ✅ Test 1: Dropdown Visibility
**What we're testing**: Dropdown styling fix

**Steps**:
1. Click any dropdown (Z, n, l, m, or Visualization Mode)
2. Observe the option list

**Expected Result**:
- All options have **solid white background**
- Text is **black and clearly readable**
- No transparent or hard-to-read options

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ All dropdowns have opaque white backgrounds

---

### ✅ Test 2: Debouncing (No Lag During Rapid Changes)
**What we're testing**: `useDebouncedValue` hook preventing UI freeze

**Steps**:
1. Set quantum numbers to: `Z=1, n=2, l=1, m=0`
2. **Rapidly** move the `m` slider back and forth: `0 → 1 → -1 → 0 → 1`
3. Do this as fast as possible (slider drag or rapid clicks)

**Expected Result**:
- UI stays **responsive** (no freezing)
- Only the **final value** triggers orbital recalculation
- Smooth transitions, no lag spikes

**Before Fix**: UI would freeze for 150-300ms on each change
**After Fix**: Smooth, batched updates

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ No perceptible lag or freezing during rapid changes

---

### ✅ Test 3: Quantum Number Validation (No White Screen)
**What we're testing**: Validation layer preventing invalid states

**Steps**:
1. Set: `n=4, l=2, m=2`
2. Change `l` from `2` to `3`
3. Watch what happens to `m`

**Expected Result**:
- **No white screen** or crash
- `m` is automatically clamped to valid range (0 in this case, or max ±3)
- Smooth transition, no errors in console

**Before Fix**: Would cause white screen crash
**After Fix**: Automatic validation and clamping

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ No crashes, smooth transitions

---

### ⚡ Test 4: Orbital Caching (Instant Transitions)
**What we're testing**: Predictive pre-caching for instant transitions

#### Part A: First-Time Cache Miss
**Steps**:
1. Set: `n=2, l=1, m=0`
2. **Wait 2 seconds** (allow initial render)
3. Open browser DevTools Console
4. Change `m` from `0` to `1`
5. Note the transition time

**Expected Result**:
- First time changing to `m=1`: ~150ms (cache miss, needs calculation)
- You might see a brief calculation

#### Part B: Second-Time Cache Hit
**Steps**:
1. Continuing from above, change `m` from `1` back to `0`
2. Watch closely for transition speed

**Expected Result**:
- **Instant transition** (0-10ms)
- No visible calculation delay
- Smooth, immediate visual update

#### Part C: Pre-cached Neighborhood
**Steps**:
1. Set: `n=2, l=1, m=0`
2. **Wait 3 seconds** (preloader caches m=-1, 0, 1 automatically)
3. Rapidly cycle through: `m: 0 → 1 → -1 → 0 → 1 → -1`
4. Note that **all transitions are instant**

**Expected Result**:
- After initial 3-second preload, **ALL** m transitions are instant
- No lag, no freezing
- Feels incredibly responsive

**Performance Comparison**:

| Operation | Without Cache | With Cache (Hit) |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| Change m (0→1) | 150ms | **0ms** ⚡ |
| Change m (0→1→-1→0) | 450ms total | **0ms** ⚡ |
| Change l (0→1) | 200ms | ~50ms (preloaded) |

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Instant transitions after preload period

---

### 🔍 Test 5: Cache Statistics (Advanced)
**What we're testing**: Cache hit rate and performance monitoring

**Steps**:
1. Open browser DevTools Console
2. Type (if stats are exposed):
   ```javascript
   // This would need to be added to window for debugging
   // For now, observe the behavior
   ```
3. Perform Test 4 (cycling through m values)
4. Check console for any preload messages

**Expected Behavior**:
- Background preloading messages in console
- No errors during preload
- Smooth operation

**Note**: Full stats API can be exposed for debugging if needed

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dropdowns still transparent
**Solution**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

### Issue: Still seeing lag when changing quantum numbers
**Check**:
1. Are you using a complex orbital (n>4, high particle count)?
2. Is performance mode enabled?
3. Open console and check for errors

**Solution**: The debouncing is working, but complex orbitals take time to calculate even with caching. First-time calculations will still take 150-500ms.

### Issue: White screen crash still happening
**Check**: What quantum numbers caused it?
**Report**: Please note the exact sequence (Z, n, l, m) that causes the issue

### Issue: Not seeing instant transitions
**Check**:
1. Did you wait for preload? (3 seconds after setting quantum numbers)
2. Are you changing `m` values? (m is cached with highest priority)
3. Check browser console for cache-related errors

**Solution**: First-time changes always require calculation. After preload, subsequent changes should be instant.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

### How to Measure Cache Performance

**Manual Method**:
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Start recording
3. Change m from 0 to 1 (first time)
4. Stop recording
5. Look at "Main" thread - should see ~150ms calculation

6. Start recording again
7. Change m from 1 to 0 (cached)
8. Stop recording
9. Look at "Main" thread - should see ~0-10ms!

### Expected Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Verify |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Cache hit (m changes) | 0-10ms | Performance tab |
| Cache miss (first time) | 100-200ms | Performance tab |
| Memory usage | <120MB | DevTools Memory |
| Cache size | 20-30 orbitals | Console stats (if exposed) |
| Preload latency | <300ms | Console logs |

## ✨ What You Should Experience

### The "Wow" Moment
After Phase 1 improvements:

1. **Instant Responsiveness**: Changing m values feels like switching images, not recalculating physics
2. **No Freezing**: Rapid slider movements stay smooth
3. **No Crashes**: All quantum number combinations work
4. **Professional Feel**: The app feels polished and production-ready

### Before vs After

**BEFORE Phase 1**:
- Change m: Wait... wait... *screen freezes* ... finally renders
- Rapid changes: Lag, lag, lag, cumulative freezing
- Change from l=2 to l=3 with n=4: WHITE SCREEN CRASH
- Overall feel: Prototype, clunky, frustrating

**AFTER Phase 1**:
- Change m: **Instant!** ⚡
- Rapid changes: **Smooth as butter** 🧈
- All quantum number transitions: **Smooth, validated, no crashes**
- Overall feel: **Professional, polished, production-ready** ✨

## 🎓 Understanding the Magic

### How Caching Works

```
User at n=2, l=1, m=0
  ↓
System automatically preloads in background:
  - m = -1 (high priority)
  - m = +1 (high priority)
  - n = 1, l=0 (medium priority)
  - n = 3, l=1 (medium priority)
  ↓
User changes m to 1
  ↓
INSTANT! Already cached! ⚡
  ↓
System preloads NEXT neighborhood:
  - m = -1, 0 (high priority)
  - etc.
```

### Memory Management

- **Max cache size**: 30 orbitals
- **Max memory**: ~100MB
- **Eviction policy**: LRU (Least Recently Used)
- **Result**: Always fast, never bloated

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

If all tests pass, Phase 1 is **COMPLETE**! 🎉

Ready to move on to:
- **Feature #11**: Code cleanup (remove unused files)
- **Feature #10**: Mobile responsive design
- **Phase 2**: Visual enhancements (light mode, nodal planes, etc.)
